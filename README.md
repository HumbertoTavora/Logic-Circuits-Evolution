## Introduction

Welcome to my experiment repository! Here, you will find a collection of various projects and experiments I have worked on. Each experiment is documented with detailed instructions and results.

## Setup

VEDA module requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and some basics modules to run. 

- Random
- Datetime
- Bisect

If you don't have theses modules, run the following commands:

```sh
pip install random
pip install datetime
pip install bisect
```

To install the module VEDA run the following commands...

```sh
pip install VLCDA
```
Be sure to maintain pip updated ...
```sh
pip install --upgrade VLCDA
```

To replicate the experiments on your machine, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.8 or higher)
- Git

### Installation Rep

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    gh repo clone HumbertoTavora/Logic-Circuits-Evolution
    cd Logic-Circuits-Evolution
    ```
