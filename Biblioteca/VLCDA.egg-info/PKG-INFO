## Virtual Logic Circuits Design Automation

Python module dedicated to the evolution of logic circuits through genetic algorithms

- Evolving Combinational Logic Circuits through genetic algorithm
- A set of Odd Parity Generetors evolveds until the 100% Fitness 


> To exploit the true potential of emerging nanotechnologies, automation of the
> electronic design (EDA) of digital systems must be rethought. The digital projects

> Mind you, these are characteristics of biological systems shaped by evolution. algorithms
> genetics can be used for the synthesis of digital systems when hard-
> fully integrated ware, such as those imposed by programmable devices.
> It has even been pointed out that as digital circuits evolve, fault handling strategies
> recognized by evolution reappear naturally.


## Installation

VEDA module requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and some basics modules to run. 

- Random
- Datetime
- Bisect

If you don't have theses modules, run the following commands:

```sh
pip install random
pip install datetime
pip install bisect
```

To install the module VEDA run the following commands...

```sh
pip install VEDA
```
Be sure to maintain pip updated ...
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
